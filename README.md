# SO YOU WANT TO MAKE A WORD CAMERA?

You should, because lexography is for everyone. 

Feel free to use my code to get yourself started. However, it is licensed under GPL v3, which means you must make your code available under the same terms.

## Cautionary Preamble

I wrote this code as a creative exercise rather than an engineering task. I plan to clean it up and improve its documentation when I have a chance.


## Running Your Own Copy

In theory, following these steps should allow you to run your own copy of the word.camera software on a Unix-based operating system (word.camera is running this software on Ubuntu 14.04):

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtualenv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create new empty directories at `static/img/` and `static/output/` -- these folders are for processed images and rendered html files, respectively.
4. Download the [Clarifai Python API wrapper](https://github.com/Clarifai/Clarifai_py), change that folder's name to `py` (or change the import line in `__init__.py`), create a [Clarifai API](http://clarifai.com) account, and set environmental variables to match your API key and secret following procedures described in [the library's README file](https://github.com/Clarifai/Clarifai_py/blob/master/README.md).
5. Download a local copy of the [ConceptNet5](http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/) database, following [the recommended procedure](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Running-your-own-copy), and run an instance of the API server at `127.0.0.1:8084`. (If you try to change the endpoint URL to MIT's ConceptNet5 API server rather than downloading your own copy, the rate limit may restrict you.)
6. Change the following global variables in `__init__.py` to match the filepaths on your machine: `SYSPATH`, `APPPATH`, `app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']` (all directly below the imports at the top of the file)
7. Change the `BASEURL` global variable in `__init__.py` to match the IP or domain where you plan to run your server.
8. Add a `salty.py` file in the main directory with one variable, `saline`, set equal to a string of your choice (to seed unique URL hash values).
9. Run `python __init__.py` or set up a WSGI server. (word.camera uses [apache2](http://httpd.apache.org/) for the web server and [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) for the ConceptNet server on localhost.)


Good luck, and [enjoy](http://word.camera/i/DEdwqKR3J)!
